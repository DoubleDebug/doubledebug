Technical Office is a management system for construction engineering drawings and assignments. It was a 30 to 45 day project for a client from Portugal. The client didn't have tech stack requirements so I decided to go with a simple combination of plain Javascript and Firebase as a BAAS (backend as a service). The client had a large number of requirements and a relatively short delivery deadline so I decided to go with Tailwind as the CSS library.

- Firebase
  - User authentication
